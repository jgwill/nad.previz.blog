Those who knows me know I am not a fan of Microsoft product. STOP! Here is my limit on Microsoft because otherwise I will bore you of a reactive wave against what I don't like (which fundamentally is caused by their orientation trying to solve problem instead of creating/innovating. And both orientations are mutually exclusive, so: creative problem-solving is just something that can't be.

Anyways, using Snip & Sketch is just a good example of being not really satisfied and not really having what I want (which is where you are when you problem-solve -> no problem is often not really what you want !!)  
Snip & Sketch is one of those unsatisfying product resulting from Microsoft best efforts.

It stopped working and instead of solving the problem, I oriented myself toward what I truely desire a screen capture app to do and organically got to ShareX which I appreciated after I figured out to reprogram the hotkey for the region capture.
