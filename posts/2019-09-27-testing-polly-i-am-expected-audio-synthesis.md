I want my text being read and available as podcast. I am also expecting live to get an updated audio being generated by the service.

**Amazon Polly** is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. **Amazon Polly** is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice.
