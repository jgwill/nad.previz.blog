# **WHAT IS VIRTUAL PRODUCTION?**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Real-time, virtual production is an evolution of the virtual production technology that made Avatar possible, and today a workflow that allows filmmakers to turn their vision into reality. The real-time, virtual production process combines the best of traditional filmmaking, CGI, VFX pipelines, previs workflows and real-time game engine technologies to give filmmakers something tangible that they can see, touch and interact with, when combining live action and virtual sets, and performances.” 1.
