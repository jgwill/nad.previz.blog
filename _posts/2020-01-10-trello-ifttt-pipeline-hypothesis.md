@STCGoal a pipeline where I can quickly draft a content and get an item written on my web app I can review and work more in depth and enable further extended feature to integrate with my content

Trello - @stcpipeline there is an iOS app !!

@STCIssue First step in drafting is “either simple and continuous integration not available” or “too rigid and road a bit long to get there” (even though rigorously that is where it should be)

@STCGoal Hypothesis that the Trello app will enable an IFTTT service to extract my annotated content and draft another in my rigorous app.
