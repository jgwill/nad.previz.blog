<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was just noticing that I had integrated by WPApp with Slack?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What does that mean?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It means I am getting a new message on a Slack channel when I create new post in my WPApp. 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What is the usage of that ? Those related to the channel can learn a new post was done. I can keep track of my new post in that channel along with other message. I can set a reminder for reviewing a post... list goes infinite

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How did I do it?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

/rss $MY_WPAPP_RSS_FEED

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That simple?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

ya :)
