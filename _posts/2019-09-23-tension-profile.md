This diagram reveals three basic characteristics of musical tension:

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  There is a gradual rise towards the climax – the moment of maximum intensity, which then resolves to bring the music to its finish.  
      
    
2.  Some level of tension is always present. The complete and total resolution comes only at the very end with the conclusion of the piece itself.  
      
    
3.  Since the contour rises and falls in different amounts, the tension profile also shows us that the release doesn’t have to be complete all the time. (If it were, every new rise in intensity would be met by an equal fall). Resolutions can be partial, delayed or even avoided altogether.
