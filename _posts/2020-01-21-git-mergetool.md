@STCIssue It is great to use repository to manage file in a distributed perspective, though, it is not obvious for me to solve merge that involve the modularity of the main repository (while I am working multiple platform on the same repo, I sometime do not commit and merge and pull back my module on the other platform or cross related work is made on the same file and they conflict on the main repo and are requiring merging.) Can that be fully automated ?
