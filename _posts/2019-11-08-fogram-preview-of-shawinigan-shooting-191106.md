<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I got few background plates from shooting while moving out my stuff from Shawinigan (good distraction because moving my stuff is not something I love but must do for my comfort in Montreal while doing my Master degree at NAD school)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Anyhow, here are some of them with intentions 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The overall intention is creating an acceptable VFX synthesis of natural environment along with constructing few 3d model from the foreground to render the shot appreciable while moving the camera

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To be continued 

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Bellow are some of the elements of the composition. Among them: foreground and background reference plate, foreground element (sample part of the photogrammetry set), Sky element (ref as the 16 bit RAW are still on the SLR camera)
