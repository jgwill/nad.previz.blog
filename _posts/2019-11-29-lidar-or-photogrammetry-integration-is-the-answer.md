  LiDAR or Photogrammetry? Integration is
  the answer
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: 'In  the  last  few  years,  LiDAR  and  image-matching  techniques  have  been  employed  in many application fields because of their quickness in point cloud generation. Nevertheless, the use of only one of these techniques is not sufficient to extract automatically reliable information. In this paper, an integration approach of these techniques is proposed in order to overcome their individual weakness. The goal of this work is the automated extraction of man-made object outlines in order to reduce the human intervention during the data processing simplifying the work of the users. This approach has been implemented on both terrestrial and aerial applications, showing the reliability and the potentiality of this kind of integration. '
