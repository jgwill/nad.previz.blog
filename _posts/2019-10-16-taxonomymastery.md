<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I described it as :  
This term is a structural term I got from Robert Fritz in Creating your life course -Mastery is the vision we have regarding process. example : "Mastery of Photoshop" is the actual end-result we desire, in contrast, an inadequate way to plan is saying : practice Photoshop which has no end-result. Another example of inadequacy is : Run 4 miles per week, rather, "Optimal Health" is the goal.
