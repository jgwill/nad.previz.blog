author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: "Working on mastering houdini, I came across a documenting pattern in my practice that both made whatever you are in my networks intention clear, along that I extended the interface of the parent note which lead to abstracting the important concepts to understand and choose by then which PARAMETERIZATION I would made.  The results is a reusable Raining network with a top level interface and also sub-level network also have their interface which is less abstract than the root one."
