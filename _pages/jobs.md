Planned positions for my master degree in Art - all interventions from external resources are given as if that was a professional context. Be advised, original intentions are to bring my arts to a professional master level as Nad and myself would see it. To execute such actions on my Nad’s master degree, each individual participating mush pass a structural thinking evaluation or have read one of Robert Fritz’s major books such as Path of least resistance. (Note that not all individual are required to do such reading as in their practice of professional art, they built naturally such skills.
